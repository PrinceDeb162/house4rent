# house4rent
This repository is for our CSE299 (Junior Design) project. We are developing an web version application named "house4rent". 
This is basically an online house rent system.  
This web application is very user-
friendly, efficient and it has got many unique features that are not offered
by other currently available house rental websites here in Bangladesh. Tenants
can register using their phone number, store information about their
identity, search for available houses, send messages to house owners, and
choose a suitable house using developed web applications. House owners can
also register for the system, which will manually verify and authenticate the
knowledge provided by the house owner can view a tenant’s information history
whenever a tenant makes contact through text and supply house-related
information accordingly.
